This project presents a comprehensive University Database Management System designed to streamline student information management, course scheduling, faculty assignments, and grading processes. The system is structured around five primary tables: \texttt{Students}, \texttt{Classes}, \texttt{Courses}, \texttt{Departments}, and \texttt{Faculty}, with an additional \texttt{Authentication} table to manage user access. The \texttt{Students} table tracks individual student details and their associated classes. The \texttt{Classes} table categorizes various class sections and links them to specific courses and faculty members. The \texttt{Courses} table contains information on academic courses, including credit hours and semester details. The \texttt{Departments} table manages department-specific information and heads. The \texttt{Faculty} table records faculty members' personal details and their departmental affiliations. The \texttt{Authentication} table ensures secure user access with different roles.

The database employs two key views: \texttt{StudentPerformanceView}, which aggregates student performance data including grades, and \texttt{FacultyCoursesView}, which displays course assignments and faculty details. This setup enables efficient querying and management of academic data, ensuring that all components of the university's academic operations are interconnected and easily accessible.

The system is designed to support dynamic querying and reporting, aiding academic administration in maintaining accurate records and generating insightful reports. Potential outcomes include improved data management efficiency, enhanced academic oversight, and streamlined administrative operations.
